# Section 1: Lojack opens, Bn 3Bets, and Lojack Calls

Blinds are $0.05/$0.10. Effective stacks are $10.00. You're in the LJ and you open for $0.30 (3bb). Action folds to the BN who 3Bets you to $0.90, a 3x raise. SB and BB both fold, and action is back to you. You call from out of position and go to the flop with $9.10 behind and a pot of $1.95. Action is on you.
