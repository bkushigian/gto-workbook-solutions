### Flop 1: <b>A<span style="color:#000000;">&spades;</span>T<span style="color:#0088ff;">&diams;</span>5<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span></b>
1. **Approximate each player's equity. Who has the equity advantage?**

    SB should have about 55% equity

2. **What are the weakest hands in your range that could go all in on the flop? Go for three streets of value on blank turns?**

    Weakest hands I'd shove for value:
    + Some top pair (AK, AQ)
    
    Possible bluff shoves:
    + Some KQ, KJ, QJ w/ a BDFD?

    Weakest hands I'd call a shove with:
    + Probably some top pair (AK, AQ)

    + **Question:** how do suits affect my calling range? Do I prefer to block or
      unblock flush draws? I'd imagine I'd rather unblock flush draws. This means
      I'd probably prefer to call with AhKh than AdKd.
      BB doesn't have QJ in range, but if they did I'd prefer to unblock it as
      a potential bluff.


3. **Which player has the nuts advantage?**
   About even, maybe? We can have AA, TT, and 55, versus BB's 55. We do
   have about 3x the hands in range as BB so we should have around the same percentage
   sets, but ours are stronger. We also have AT, all A5 (they have A5o tho), and some T5s.
   Thus we have better 2pair, though  they should have a similar number of combos.



4. **How static or dynamic is this flop? What aspects of this flop make it more static or dynamic?  How do these aspects interact with one another?**

5. **Do you want to develop a betting range? Which hands prefer to bet?**

6. **Do you want to develop a checking range? If so, estimate a x/f, x/c, and x/r range?**

7. **Suppose you check and villain checks behind. What are the best and worst turn cards for your range? Do any give you an equity advantage? A nuts advantage? Uncap your range?**

8. **Suppose you check, villain bets 1/3 pot, and you call. What are the best and worst turn cards for your range? Do any give you an equity advantage? A nuts advantage? Uncap your range?**
