### Flop 1: <b>A<span style="color:#000000;">&spades;</span>T<span style="color:#0088ff;">&diams;</span>5<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span></b>
1. **Approximate each player's equity. Who has the equity advantage?** The button has a significant equity advantage on this flop, probably about 55%.  2. **What are the weakest hands that could go all in on the flop? Go for three streets of value on blank turns?** The some two pair like AT, A5, and maybe even T5, should be willing to go all in on this flop.  Top pair top kicker can go for three streets, and maybe get all in on this flop?  3. **Which player has the nuts advantage?** The button has a clear nuts advantage.

4. **How static or dynamic is this flop? What aspects of this flop make it more static or dynamic?  How do these aspects interact with one another?**


   This is a very static flop. It is rainbow with a high card and no straights
   on board. There are some gutshots but most of these belong to the button who
   already has the equity and nuts advantage, so turns like a KQJ won't change
   benefit the big blind's range.

5. **On this flop do you prefer to bet small or large?  With what frequencies would you check and bet?**

   If we cbet small and BB calls we are happy to see any KQJ. Worst cards are a
   ten or a 5.

6. **Say you adopt a strategy where you either bet with your preferred sizing or check. You choose to bet and villain calls. What are the best and worst turn cards for your range?**

   I prefer a small cbet with 100% frequency.
