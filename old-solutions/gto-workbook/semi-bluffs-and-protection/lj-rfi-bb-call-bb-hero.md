1. **Approximate each player's equity. Who has the equity advantage?**

    LJ: 55%, BB: 45%

2. **What are the weakest hands that could go all in on the flop? Go for three streets of value on blank turns?**

    AQ+ can get it in on the flop, though they are also happy seeing turns.
    2pairs also happy to get it in.

3. **Which player has the nuts advantage?**

    LJ has AA, TT, and a good chunk of 2pair (though BB also has as many 2pair,
    if not more, as LJ). 

4. **How static or dynamic is this flop? What aspects of this flop make it more static or dynamic?  How do these aspects interact with one another?**

    This is a very static flop.

5. **On this flop do you prefer to bet small or large?  With what frequencies would you check and bet?**

    In the LJ I want to bet small with range.

6. **Say you adopt a strategy where you either bet with your preferred sizing or check. You choose to bet and villain calls. What are the best and worst turn cards for your range?**

    + **Best Turns:** Any K, Q or J should be really good. Preferrably a heart,
      but that doesn't matter too much. I'm not sure about an A. This blocks
      a lot of our strongest holdings but also blocks a good chunk of their
      value calling range.

    + **Worst Turns:** We don't want to see a 5 or a T. The 5 is especially bad
      since it
